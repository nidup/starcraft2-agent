Starcraft2 Nidup's agents
=========================

Agents using Reinforcement Learning and [Deepmind PySC2](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) - StarCraft II Learning Environment ðŸ¤–

These agents have been built to work properly on the Simple64 map, as a Terran player.
They are not robust enough to play elsewhere.

All the following data have been collected playing against the default built-in AI (very-easy difficulty).

Agents can be installed following [this doc](doc/install.md).

Basic agents (scripted)
-----------------------

Here are [few scripted agents](doc/scripted_agents.md) (built to discover the API).

Reinforcement Marine Agent (Machine Learning)
---------------------------------------------

This agent uses a Q-Learning table, a reduced set of actions (build supply depot, barrack, train marine & attack) and a sparse reward depending on the result of the episode.

It has been slightly fine-tuned to be trained faster and win more games against the built-in AI.
[Here are more details on training and attempts](doc/reinforcement_marine_agent.md).

Hybrid Reinforcement Attack Agent (Machine Learning)
----------------------------------------------------

This agent uses the same Q-Learning approach but specialized on the train units & attack phase.

The build order phase is scripted to reduce the set of actions and focus the training on the attack.

[Here are more details on improvements](doc/reinforcement_attack_agent.md).

```
$ python3.6 -m pysc2.bin.agent --map Simple64 --agent nidup.pysc2.agents.HybridAttackReinforcementAgent --agent_race T --max_agent_steps=1000000
```

Data & Analysis
---------------

The game results are stored in `data` folder using a different file per agent.

The file is suffixed by `_results` and contains a pandas DataFrame.

Generate the result report graph:
```
$ python3.6 generate_report.py --agent-name nidup.pysc2.agents.ReinforcementMarineAgent
```

Query the game results:
```
$ python3.6 generate_report.py --agent-name nidup.pysc2.agents.ReinforcementMarineAgent --filter win
```
