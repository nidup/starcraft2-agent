Starcraft2 Nidup's agents
=========================

Starcraft2 agents using Reinforcement Learning and [Deepmind PySC2](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) - StarCraft II Learning Environment ðŸ¤–

These agents have been built to work properly on the Simple64 map, as a Terran player.

They are not robust enough to play elsewhere.

All the following data have been collected playing against the built-in AI, trying to progressively raise its difficulty mode.

Agents can be installed following [this doc](doc/install.md).

Basic agents (scripted)
-----------------------

Here are [few scripted agents](doc/scripted_agents.md) (built to discover the API).

Reinforcement Marine Agent (Machine Learning)
---------------------------------------------

This agent uses a Q-Learning table, a reduced set of actions (build supply depot, barrack, train marine & attack) and a sparse reward depending on the result of the episode.
It has been slightly fine-tuned to be trained faster and win more games against the built-in AI.
[Here are more details on training and attempts](doc/reinforcement_marine_agent.md).

Hybrid Reinforcement Attack Agent (Machine Learning)
----------------------------------------------------

This agent uses the same Q-Learning approach but specialized on the train units & attack phase.
The build order phase is scripted to reduce the set of actions and focus the training on the attack.
The build order and actions are enriched to train marines & marauders.
[Here are more details on improvements](doc/reinforcement_attack_agent.md).

Data & Analysis
---------------

The game results are stored in `data` folder using a different file per agent.

The file is suffixed by `_results` and contains a pandas DataFrame.

Generate the result report graph:
```
$ python3.6 generate_report.py --agent-name nidup.pysc2.agents.ReinforcementMarineAgent
```

Query the game results:
```
$ python3.6 generate_report.py --agent-name nidup.pysc2.agents.ReinforcementMarineAgent --filter win
```
